## üìù Best Practices

### For Short-Term Strategies

1. **Focus on recent data** - Older data may be less relevant
2. **Include transaction costs** - Critical for high-frequency strategies
3. **Test different market sessions** - Asian, European, US hours
4. **Consider spreads and slippage** - Especially for scalping strategies
5. **Paper trade extensively** - Validate before going live

### For Mid-Term Strategies

1. **Include seasonal patterns** - Quarter-end effects, holidays
2. **Test across market regimes** - Bull, bear, sideways periods
3. **Validate economic impact** - Fed announcements, major news
4. **Consider gradual scaling** - Build positions over time
5. **Monitor correlation changes** - Market relationships evolve

### For Long-Term Strategies

1. **Include complete cycles** - Full bull/bear market cycles
2. **Consider regulatory changes** - Long-term landscape shifts
3. **Test technology adoption** - Blockchain evolution impacts
